## Description
This project is a WhatsApp bot created out of boredom and just for fun, but it incorporates several powerful technologies to create a functional and flexible bot. The bot leverages the **Laurine API** to provide a set of features and functionalities. These features allow the bot to handle automated tasks, interact with WhatsApp users, and perform various custom actions, all designed to make WhatsApp interaction more efficient and easy.

The bot supports **custom pairing**, **button interactiveMessage**, and **buttonMessage**, enabling dynamic and engaging interactions. With **button interactiveMessage** and **buttonMessage**, the bot can send messages with interactive buttons that users can click, making the interaction more engaging and allowing users to choose options without typing responses manually.

Although this bot started as a fun project, it has the potential to evolve into a more robust automation tool. With open-source code, the bot can be easily extended to meet various needs. Whether it's automating responses, creating custom triggers, or simply managing interactions, this bot is designed to make WhatsApp usage more efficient and customizable.

## Baileys
**Baileys** is a Node.js library that facilitates interaction with the WhatsApp Web API. It allows the bot to send and receive WhatsApp messages, as well as automate various tasks and interactions with users. Baileys supports automatic session management, message processing, and status handling in the context of WhatsApp.

The bot uses **Baileys** to connect to WhatsApp, enabling functionalities like sending messages, automating responses, and scheduling tasks. By utilizing **whiskeysockets**, Baileys provides support for **custom pairing** and interactive features like **button interactiveMessage** and **buttonMessage**, which allow the bot to send messages with clickable buttons for a more dynamic user experience.

With Baileys and `whiskeysockets`, this project offers a platform to develop WhatsApp bots that can be tailored to various scenarios, allowing further expansion of WhatsApp automation bots.

## How to Use

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kiuur/laurine-wabot.git
   cd laurine-wabot
   npm install
   npm start
```

This will run the WhatsApp bot, and you can start interacting with it.

Now the **WhatsApp Bot** and **Baileys** descriptions are clearly separated, with a more detailed explanation of their roles. Let me know if you need any further changes!
